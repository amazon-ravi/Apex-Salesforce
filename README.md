Enterprise Application Development
I will be implementing the CRM application for a Chemical Equipment and Processing Company. This company deals with suppliers and provides services. I will work out small code snippets related to this example throughout our tutorial to understand every concept in detail.

For executing the code in this tutorial, you will need to have two objects created: Customer and Invoice objects. If you already know how to create these objects in Salesforce, you can skip the steps given below. Else, you can follow the step by step guide below.

Creating Customer Object
I will be setting up the Customer object first.

Step 1 − Go to Setup and then search for 'Object' as shown below. Then click on the Objects link as shown below.
Step 2 − Once the object page is opened, then click on the 'Create New Object' button as shown below.
Step 3 − After clicking on button, the new object creation page will appear and then enter all the object details as entered below. Object name should be Customer. You just have to enter the information in the field as shown in the screenshot below and keep other default things as it is.
Enter the information and then click on the 'Save' button −
By following the above steps, we have successfully created the Customer object.

Creating the Custom Fields for Customer object
Now that we have our Customer object set up, we will create a field 'Active' and then you can create the other fields by following similar steps. The Name and API name of the field will be given in the screenshot.

Step 1 − We will be creating a field named as 'Active' of data type as Checkbox. Go to Setup and click on it.
Step 2 − Search for 'Object' as shown below and click on it.
Step 3 − Click on object 'Customer'.
Step 4 − Once you have clicked on the Customer object link and the object detail page appears, click on the New button.
